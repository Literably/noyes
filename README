Noyes is a signal processing library.  It currently has just enough signal
processing to produce features suitable for speech recognition.

Pronunciation:  Typically pronounced the same as 'noise'.  But "NO!... YES!" is
considered acceptable if you yell it loudly enough or at least with sufficient
conviction to make people think you have truly changed your mind.

Noyes is implemented entirely in Ruby.  It's also implemented entirely in Java.
The Java version has Ruby bindings too.  So you can have Java's speed from
Ruby.  All versions share the same unit tests, which are written in Ruby.  The
design goal is to have signal processing routines that are so simple and so
disentangled from the overall system that anyone could extract any of the
routines and use them elsewhere with little trouble.  Benchmarks are included.

Requirements:
  Almost any version of ruby & rake.
  Java, if you want to use the Java version.

For usage information:
  rake -T
