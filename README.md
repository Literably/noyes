## Overview
Noyes is a signal processing library.  It is designed to be fast, efficient,
portable, and expressive.  For more information on how this is accomplished
please read the design section.  It has enough signal processing routines to
produce features suitable for speech recognition, but it has many other uses.
This release contains independent implementations written in Ruby, C, and Java.

## Pronunciation
Typically pronounced the same as 'noise'.  But "No!... Yes!" is
considered acceptable if you say it with sufficient conviction to make people
think you have truly changed your mind.

## Why use Noyes?

* You need something small -- Not an entire recognition system or framework.
* You want a high degree of test coverage
* You want to be able to design and test using a scripting language.
* You want a version in pure C.
* You want a version in pure Java.
* You want Ruby wrappers for the above versions
* You want a version in pure Ruby.

## Raison d'Ãªtre
Noyes is a general purpose signal processing tool that is flexible enough for
many purposes.  However, it exists because there is a need for low-latency high
quality speech recognition on portable wireless devices.  The most powerful
speech recognizers are very large with huge models running on powerful cloud
based systems.  But transmitting raw audio to these recognizers creates too
much latency because raw audio uses too much bandwidth.  By sending compressed
features instead of raw audio the bandwidth can be greatly reduced without
compromising recognition accuracy.  In some cases the effect of inadequate
bandwidth on latency can be reduced to zero.

## Requirements:
* Almost any version of Ruby & Rake
* Java, if you want to use the Java implementation
* A C compiler if you want to use the C version

Some of the utility scripts such as nrec may use sox, but
none of the core routines use it.

## Build instructions
  rake -T
